    <p>
    Our pole sleeve is a protective sleeve that wraps around the bottom part of utility poles, keeping them from rotting and preventing chemicals from leaching into the soil. It’s a non-toxic, impermeable barrier that traps the preservative inside the pole. Traditional preservatives like creosote are often used to treat poles, but they’re oil-based and eventually leak out of the pole into the surrounding soil, which not only reduces the pole’s effectiveness but also harms the environment. The BPS stops that from happening by keeping the chemicals inside the pole, particularly in the base, where they build up and make the pole stronger over time.

    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> Why An Alternative To Creosote is Needed.</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
    Creosote has been the go-to preservative for utility poles, railroad ties, and other wooden structures for decades. It’s used everywhere because it effectively protects wood from rot, insects, and fungal growth. By soaking into the wood, it creates a protective barrier that helps extend the life of the structure, making it ideal for outdoor environments. Everyone uses it—utility companies, railroads, and other industries rely on it to keep their wooden structures standing strong in tough conditions. But despite its widespread use, creosote comes with some serious problems that are hard to overlook. 
    The main issue is that creosote contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are toxic and cancer-causing. Anyone exposed to it, whether directly or through fumes, is at risk. On top of that, when creosote leaks into the soil over time, it doesn’t just threaten human health—it also pollutes the environment. The chemicals can linger in the soil for years, contaminating the ecosystem and potentially reaching groundwater supplies.
    As creosote leaks out, it stops doing its job of preserving the wood. The wood becomes more susceptible to decay, weakening the structure of the pole. This results in poles that lose strength and stability much sooner than expected. Instead of lasting as long as they should, the poles start to break down faster, leading to more frequent repairs or even earlier replacement.
    This doesn’t just increase maintenance costs; it means more creosote-treated wood is discarded, contributing to environmental waste. While being widely used by many companies, creosote’s toxic effects, environmental damage, and short-lived effectiveness make it a terrible long-term solution. The health risks, contamination, and added costs make it clear that safer and more sustainable alternatives are way overdue since so many industries rely on it.

    <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-folder-open"></i> The Technical Feasability Of Our Pole Sleeve.</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Our pole sleeve was first tested in Africa in 1993. 
        The goal was to see if it could stop poles from rotting and help them 
        last longer. The initial tests used prototypes on stakes, and the results showed the system was effective in preventing 
        decay. After this, the system was tested in Europe and in the tropical climate of Guadeloupe as part of an EU-funded project 
        that ran from 1998 to 2002. These trials confirmed that the BPS worked well in both temperate and tropical climates. By 1999, 
        the BPS had already shown good results on utility poles in Africa, where it helped keep poles in service longer and cut down on 
        maintenance. The testing didn’t end there. In 2004, a long-term trial was started in the United States by the 
        Electrical Power Research Institute (EPRI). This trial tracked how the BPS performed on utility poles over time to see if it could 
        offer a reliable, long-lasting solution to pole decay. Five years into the trial, the results still showed the system was working a
        s intended, preventing decay and helping poles last longer in different environments. These ongoing trials, with prototypes and 
        commercial versions, proved that the barrier protection system is a solid option for protecting utility poles and reducing 
        maintenance costs. The BPS has been tested in various climates, from tropical heat to colder, temperate zones, and it continues to 
        show that it can protect poles and extend their lifespan.</p>
        <br>
        <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-dollar-sign"></i> Game Changing Savings with Unbeatable Value.</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
        The BPS system saves a ton of money over the life of a pole because it stops poles from 
        failing and eliminates the need for costly repairs during regular inspections. The cost savings 
        vary depending on the size of the pole inventory and the specific costs in different areas, 
        but they all show big savings if you use this tech. For example, in South Africa, they ran a 
        program to compare the costs of owning 1,000 poles over 30 years, with and without the BPS. 
        The basic model used 2003 costs but could be applied to any currency. It factored in the cost of a new pole 
        (ZAR500), the cost of installation (which can be 5–7 times the cost of the pole), the usual decay failure rate 
        (2-5% of poles), pole failure from things like fires or collisions (which varies by country), 
        and the cost to replace failed poles (7-10 times the cost of a new pole).
        The program also included the ZAR100 cost for adding a BPS to a pole but didn’t 
        factor in the cost of inspections or treating decaying poles (which would be 
        greatly reduced by using BPS), or inflation over the 30 years. At the time, a pole without 
        a BPS cost ZAR3,000, while a pole with a BPS cost ZAR3,100. The result? The total savings on 
        1,000 poles over 30 years came out to ZAR28 million. If you apply that to South Africa’s yearly rate of installing 400,000 poles,
         that’s a huge ZAR11,200 million in savings. And that’s not even counting the money saved on maintenance, which would make these 
         numbers even higher.

<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-bug-slash"></i> Safer, With No More Risks.</h4>
<hr>
<p>
Our proposed alternative is straightforward: it’s safer and doesn’t introduce any new risks. Unlike the old toxic wraps and bandages, the BPS is completely non-toxic, stable, and doesn’t fall under any dangerous chemical regulations. It fully seals the pole’s contact with the soil, stopping preservatives from leaking out, which is something the old wraps can’t do. By keeping the preservatives inside the pole, the BPS increases its durability and significantly reduces the chances of poles failing during storms, accidents, or general wear. It also allows for the use of safer preservatives, which cuts down on health risks, and most importantly, prevents harmful chemicals from leaching into the soil or contaminating groundwater.
</p>
<br>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-earth-americas"></i> Our goal is simple.</h4>
<hr>
<p>The BPS technology was specifically designed to address the growing need for an alternative to creosote, something that the proposer anticipated over 30 years ago. Unlike the older, almost impossible-to-remove wraps and bituminous bandages, the BPS doesn’t stick to the pole surfaces. This design feature allows for easy inspection of the poles, which is crucial for utilities around the world who regularly check their poles for wear and tear. The BPS has been tested and developed with various preservatives in different environments, proving its effectiveness in a wide range of conditions. For instance, when paired with oil-borne preservatives, BPS has been shown to perform better than untreated poles, as seen in vineyard tests where poles treated with creosote and BPS lasted much longer than identical poles without BPS in the same vineyards.

The real test, however, has been with utility poles, where the BPS has been in service for over 30 years. These utility poles are exposed to harsh conditions, including the intense decay that happens in tropical and subtropical climates, and yet the BPS-treated poles have outperformed non-BPS poles in durability. In fact, the CuNAP-treated version of the alternative has been successfully supplied to Seattle City Light, where it has been in service for over 26 years. The BPS has proven itself not just as a long-lasting solution but also as one that can stand up to some of the most aggressive environmental conditions, offering a reliable and sustainable alternative to creosote for pole preservation.</p>
